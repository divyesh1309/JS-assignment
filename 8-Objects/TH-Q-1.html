Q 1. What is an object in JavaScript? How are objects different from arrays? 


-> What is an object in JavaScript?

An object in JavaScript is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is a string (or Symbol) and the value can be any data type, including other objects, arrays, functions, or primitive values. Objects are used to store and manage data in a structured way.

-> Objects are also reference types, meaning that when you assign an object to a variable, you are assigning a reference to the object, not a copy of it.


Syntax for creating an object :-

let person = {
    name: "divyesh",
    age: 18,
    isaudit: true,
    greet: function() {
        console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
    }
};



-> How are objects different from arrays?

Arrays and objects are both data structures in JavaScript, but they serve different purposes and have different characteristics :-

-> Arrays are ordered collections of values, while objects are unordered collections of key-value pairs.
-> Arrays are indexed by numeric indices, while objects are indexed by string keys (or Symbols).
-> Arrays have built-in methods for manipulating ordered data, while objects have methods for managing key-value pairs.
-> Arrays are typically used for lists of items, while objects are used for representing entities with properties and behaviors.


1. Structure :- 
   -> Objects are unordered collections of key-value pairs, where each key is a string (or Symbol) and the value can be any data type.
   -> Arrays are ordered collections of values, where each value is accessed by its numeric index.


2. Indexing :-
    -> In objects, values are accessed using string keys (e.g., object.key or object[key]).
    -> In arrays, values are accessed using numeric indices (e.g., array[0], array[1]).


3. Purpose :-
    -> Objects are typically used to represent entities with properties and behaviors, such as a person or a car.
    -> Arrays are used to store lists of items, such as a list of numbers or a collection of strings.


4. Methods :-
    -> Objects can have methods (functions) associated with them that operate on their properties.
    -> Arrays have built-in methods for manipulating ordered data, such as push, pop, shift, unshift, and others.
