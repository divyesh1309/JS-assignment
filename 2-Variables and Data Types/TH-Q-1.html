Q 1. What are variables in JavaScript? How do you declare a variable using var, let, and const?

What are variables in JavaScript?

-> Variables are containers that store data values. They hold information that can be used and change throughout a program.

-> Variables are used to store data, such as numbers, strings, objects, and arrays, which can be manipulated and accessed later in the code.


Three types of variables in javascript :-
      
    1) var => var is a global variable and function scope variable 
    2) let => let is a block scope variable 
    3) const => const is a block scope variable and constant value



Declaring a variable using var, let, and const :- 

        1) var - var is a reassign and reusable variable

               var a =10;
               var b =20;

               var a =10;
               var b =20;


      2) Let - lat is re-assign but not re-usable variable

               let a =10;
               let b =20;

               let a =10; // error
               let b =20; // error


      3) const - const is not re-assign and not re-usable variable
      
               const a =10;
               const name = "divyesh";

          -> conts - never change the value of const variable
