Q 3. What is the difference between undefined and null in JavaScript?


1) Undifined

=> undefined is a primitive data type in JavaScript. It means that a variable has been declared but not assigned any value yet. JavaScript automatically assigns undefined to such variables.

Example :-
    let a;
    console.log(a);


2) Null 

=> null is a primitive data type in JavaScript. It represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is an assignment value that can be assigned to a variable to indicate that it has no value.

Example :-
    let a = null;
    console.log(a);
