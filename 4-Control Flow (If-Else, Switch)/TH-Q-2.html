Q 2. Describe how switch statements work in JavaScript. When should you use a switch statement instead of if-else?


-> A switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions. 

-> The switch statement checks the value of an expression against multiple case values. If a match is found, that case block is executed. If no case matches, the default block is executed.



Syntax :-

switch (condition) {
    case 1:
        // code to execute if condition matches 1
        break;
    case 2:
        // code to execute if condition matches 2
        break;
    more cases...
    default:
        // code to execute if no cases match
}
