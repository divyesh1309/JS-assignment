Q 1.  What is control flow in JavaScript? Explain how if-else statements work with anexample.

=>> Control flow in JavaScript means the order in which the code is executed. JavaScript runs code from top to bottom, but control flow statements like if-else, switch, for, while, etc., allow you to change this order and make decisions in your code.


if-else statements :- 

The if-else statement is used when you want to execute one block of code if a condition is true, and another block if the condition is false.


Syntax :- 

if (condition) {
    // code to execute if condition is true
} else {
    // code to execute if condition is false
}


<script>
    // var a = 5;
    // var b = '5';
    console.log(a == b);  // true, because values are equal
</script>


<script>
    // == is the equality operator that checks for value equality, ignoring the type of the operands.
    // === is the strict equality operator that checks for both value and type equality.
    
    let a = 5;
    let b = '5';
    
    console.log(a == b);  // true, because values are equal
    console.log(a === b); // false, because types are different (number vs string)
</script>

<script>

// Example 

let age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You are an adult.");
} else {
    console.log("You are a minor.");
}

</script>
