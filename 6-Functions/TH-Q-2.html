Q 2. What is the difference between a function declaration and a function expression?


1) Function Declaration :-

-> A function declaration is a standard way to define a function using the function keyword followed by the function name

-> This method is hoisted in JavaScript, which means it can be called even before it is defined in the code.

-> Function declarations are typically used to define functions that are intended to be called multiple times throughout the code.


Example :- 

   function display() {
       console.log("Hello!");
   }

----------------------------------------------------------

2) Function Expression :-


-> A function expression defines a function as part of an expression, typically assigned to a variable. It can be anonymous or named.

-> Function expressions are not hoisted, meaning they cannot be called before they are defined in the code.

-> function expressions can be used to create functions that are passed as arguments, returned from other functions, or assigned to variables. 


Example :- 

   const display = function() {
       console.log("Hello!");
   };
