Q 1. What are functions in JavaScript? Explain the syntax for declaring and calling a function.


What is function ? 

-> A function in JavaScript is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions can take inputs, called parameters, and can return a value. They help in organizing code, making it more modular and easier to maintain.

-> You define a function once, and call it any number of times.

-> Functions help make your code cleaner, modular, and easier to debug.


Syntax for declaring a function :-

   function functionName(parameters) {
        
        // code to be executed
   }


Calling a function is done by using its name followed by parentheses, optionally passing arguments if the function requires them.

Syntax for calling a function :-

   functionName(arguments);
