Q 3. Discuss the concept of parameters and return values in functions.


1)What are parameters?

-> Parameters are variables that are used to pass information into a function. 
-> They act as placeholders for the values that will be provided when the function is called. 
-> Parameters allow functions to operate on different data without needing to rewrite the function for each specific case.


Example :- 

    function display(name) {                        //(name is a parameter)
        console.log("Hello" + name);
    }
    display("divyesh");                 //Argument passed to the function when calling it.




2) What are return values?

-> A return value is the value that a function produces and sends back to the caller when it completes its execution.

-> The return statement is used to specify the value that should be returned from the function.


Example :- 

    function add(a, b) {                        //(a and b are parameters)
        return a + b;                            //returning the sum of a and b
    }
    let result = add(5, 10);                    //Calling the function with arguments 5 and 10
    console.log(result);
