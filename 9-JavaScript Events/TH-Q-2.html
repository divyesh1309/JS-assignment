Q 2. How does the addEventListener() method work in JavaScript? Provide an example.

=> The addEventListener() method in JavaScript is used to attach an event handler to a specified element. This means that when a particular event occurs on that element, the provided function will be executed.

=> The method takes two main arguments :- the type of event to listen for (like 'click', 'mouseover', etc.) and the function that should be executed when that event occurs. Optionally, a third argument can be provided to specify options like whether the event should be captured or not.

Syntax :-

element.addEventListener(event, function, options);
