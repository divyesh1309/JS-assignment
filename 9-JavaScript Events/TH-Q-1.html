Q 1. What are JavaScript events? Explain the role of event listeners.

-> JavaScript events are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser, which can be detected by JavaScript. These events can be triggered by user interactions such as clicking a button, submitting a form, moving the mouse, or pressing a key. They can also be triggered by other actions like loading a page or resizing the window.

-> Event listeners are functions that wait for specific events to occur. When an event occurs, the event listener executes a callback function that defines what should happen in response to that event. This allows developers to create interactive web applications by responding to user actions dynamically.


=> JavaScript events can be categorized into several types :-

1. windows event => onload , onunload, onresize, onscroll, etc..

2.mouse event => onlclick , ondbclick , mouseover , onchange , etc..

3. keyboard event => keyup , keypress , keydown

4. miscellaneous event => onblur , onsubmit , onchange,  etc..
