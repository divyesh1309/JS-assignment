Q 2. Why is error handling important in JavaScript applications?

Error handling is very important in javascript because it helps you build apps that are stable and user-friendly. It allows you to catch and manage errors gracefully, preventing your application from crashing unexpectedly. By handling errors, you can provide meaningful feedback to users, log issues for debugging, and ensure that your application continues to function smoothly even when unexpected situations arise. This leads to a better user experience and easier maintenance of the codebase.


Reasons :- 

1) Prevents App Crashes :- Error handling prevents your application from crashing when unexpected issues occur. Instead of stopping the entire program, it allows you to manage errors gracefully.

2) Improves User Experience :- Error handling allows you to provide meaningful feedback to users when something goes wrong. Instead of showing a generic error message, you can display user-friendly messages that help them understand the issue.

3) Debugging and Maintenance :- Error handling helps in debugging and maintaining your code. By logging errors, you can identify issues in your application and fix them more easily.

4) Handling Asynchronous Operations :- Error handling is crucial for managing asynchronous operations, such as API calls or database queries. It allows you to handle errors that may occur during these operations without disrupting the entire application flow.

5) Essential for large Applications :- Error handling is especially important in large applications where multiple components interact. It helps ensure that errors in one part of the application do not affect the entire system, allowing for better modularity and maintainability.
