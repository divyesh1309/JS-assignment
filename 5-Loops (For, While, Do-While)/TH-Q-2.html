Q 2. What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop?

1) while loop :- 

-> while loop checks the condition before executing the loop body. If the condition is false at the start, the loop body will not run at all.

-> In a while loop, there is a chance that the loop body might never execute if the condition is false from the beginning.

-> Use a while loop when you want to repeat an action only if the condition is true right from the start.

Syntax :-

    var i = 0;
    while (condition) {
        // code to be executed
        i++;
    }


    

2) do-while :- 

-> do-while loop checks the condition after the loop body runs. So, the loop body will always run at least once, even if the condition is false.

-> In a do-while loop, the loop body will definitely execute once, regardless of the condition.

-> Use a do-while loop when the action must happen at least once, and then continue repeating based on the condition.


Syntax :-

    var i = 0;
    do {
        // code to be executed
        i++;
    } while (condition);
