Q 1. Explain the different types of loops in JavaScript (for, while, do-while). Provide a basic example of each.


=> Loops in JavaScript are used to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition. 

=> There are three primary types of loops in JavaScript :- 
-> for 
-> while 
-> do-while 


1) for loop :-

The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known beforehand. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

Syntax :-

    var i;

    for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
        // code to be executed
    }

----------------------------------

2) while loop :-

The while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand. It continues to execute as long as the specified condition is true.

Syntax :-

    var i = 0;
    while (condition) {
        // code to be executed
        i++;
    }

--------------------------------------

3) do-while loop :-

The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the code block will be executed at least once before checking the condition.

Syntax :-

    var i = 0;
    do {
        // code to be executed
        i++;
    } while (condition);

<script>

// 1) for loop 
    // let i=5;

    // for (i=1; i<=5; i++) {
    //     console.log(i);
    // }



// 2) while loop 

    // let i=1;

    // while (i <= 20) {
    //     console.log(i);
    //     i++;
    // }



// 3) do while 

    // let i=1;

    // do {
    //     console.log(i);
    //     i++
    // } while(i<=10);


    
</script>
