Q 1. Explain the setTimeout() and setInterval() functions in JavaScript. How are theyused for timing events?

1) setTimeout() :- The setTimeout() function is used to execute a function or a piece of code after a specified delay (in milliseconds). It takes two arguments: the function to be executed and the delay time. 

Example :- 

setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("This runs after 2 seconds");
}, 2000); 

use case :- 
-> Delaying actions 
-> Scheduling tasks
-> Animation effects
-> Triggering events after user interaction



2) setInterval() :- The setInterval() function is used to repeatedly execute a function or a piece of code at specified intervals (in milliseconds). It takes two arguments: the function to be executed and the interval time.

Example :-

setInterval(function () {
  console.log("This runs every 3 seconds");
}, 3000);

use case :-
-> Periodic updates
-> Polling
-> Animation effects
