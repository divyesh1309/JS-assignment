Q 2. What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?


Difference between == and === in JavaScript

=> The == operator is called the loose equality operator. It compares only the values, and if the data types are different, JavaScript automatically converts one type to match the other. 

=> This automatic conversion is called type coercion.

Example :- 

5 == "5" 
-> true, because "5" (string) is converted to 5 (number)



----------------------------------------------------

=> The === operator is called the strict equality operator. It compares both the value and the data type. If either the value or the type is different, it returns false.

Example :- 

5 === "5"   
-> false, because number and string are different types
