Q 1.  What is the DOM (Document Object Model) in JavaScript? How does JavaScript interact with the DOM?

-> The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface provided by web browsers that represents the structure of a web document as a tree of objects. Each element in the HTML document is represented as a node in this tree, allowing developers to access and manipulate the content, structure, and style of the document using JavaScript.

-> Think of the DOM as a live, interactive representation of your webpage that JavaScript can access and modify even after the page has loaded.

->JavaScript interacts with the DOM by using methods and properties to read, change, add, or delete elements and attributes in the document.
